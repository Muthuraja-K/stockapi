# API Rate Limiting Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive rate limiting system implemented to resolve the persistent "429 Client Error: Too Many Requests" errors from Yahoo Finance and other external APIs.

## Problem Analysis
The application was experiencing frequent 429 errors due to:
1. **Aggressive API calls** - Multiple concurrent requests to Yahoo Finance
2. **No rate limiting** - API calls were made without delays
3. **High parallelism** - ThreadPoolExecutor with 20-30 workers
4. **Multiple data sources** - Calls to both Yahoo Finance and Finviz APIs

## Solution Components

### 1. Centralized Rate Limiter (`api_rate_limiter.py`)
- **Global coordination** - Single rate limiter instance across all modules
- **Conservative timing** - 0.3 calls per second (1 call every 3+ seconds)
- **Exponential backoff** - Increases delays after consecutive 429 errors
- **Circuit breaker pattern** - Temporarily blocks all API calls after 5 consecutive 429s
- **Request queuing** - Queues requests to prevent overwhelming external APIs

### 2. Rate Limiting Features
- **Adaptive delays** - Automatically adjusts based on error patterns
- **Error tracking** - Monitors consecutive 429 errors
- **Automatic recovery** - Reduces delays after successful calls
- **Manual reset** - Admin endpoint to reset circuit breaker

### 3. Implementation Across Modules
All modules making external API calls now use the centralized rate limiter:

#### `enhanced_stock_operations.py`
- ✅ Rate limiting for `yf.Ticker()` calls
- ✅ Rate limiting for Finviz API calls
- ✅ Reduced `max_workers` from 20 to 5
- ✅ Added delays between batch processing

#### `stock_summary.py`
- ✅ Rate limiting for `yf.Ticker()` calls
- ✅ Reduced `max_workers` from 30 to 5
- ✅ Added delays between batch processing

#### `history_cache.py`
- ✅ Rate limiting for `yf.Ticker()` calls
- ✅ Reduced `max_workers` from 20 to 5
- ✅ Added delays between batch processing

#### `sentiment_analysis.py`
- ✅ Rate limiting for `yf.Ticker()` calls

#### `earning_summary.py`
- ✅ Rate limiting for `yf.Ticker()` calls
- ✅ Reduced `max_workers` from 20 to 5
- ✅ Added delays between batch processing

### 4. New API Endpoints

#### GET `/api/rate-limiter-status`
Returns current rate limiter status:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "consecutive_429_errors": 0,
    "circuit_breaker_open": false,
    "circuit_breaker_opened_at": null,
    "calls_per_second": 0.3,
    "min_interval": 3.33
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00"
}
```

#### POST `/api/rate-limiter-reset` (Admin Only)
Manually resets the circuit breaker when needed.

## Configuration

### Rate Limiting Settings
```python
# Default configuration
calls_per_second = 0.3        # 1 call every 3.33 seconds
circuit_breaker_threshold = 5  # Open after 5 consecutive 429s
circuit_breaker_timeout = 60   # Keep open for 60 seconds
max_retries = 3               # Retry failed calls up to 3 times
base_delay = 3.0              # Base delay for exponential backoff
```

### ThreadPool Settings
```python
# Reduced parallelism to prevent overwhelming APIs
max_workers = 5               # Down from 20-30
batch_delay = 0.1             # 100ms delay between batch items
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Rate Limiting
```python
from api_rate_limiter import enforce_rate_limit

def my_api_function():
    enforce_rate_limit()  # Will sleep if necessary
    # Make API call here
    return result
```

### Using Safe API Functions
```python
from api_rate_limiter import safe_yfinance_call, safe_finviz_call

# These functions handle rate limiting automatically
stock_info = safe_yfinance_call("AAPL", "info")
finviz_data = safe_finviz_call("AAPL")
```

### Decorator Usage
```python
from api_rate_limiter import rate_limited, retry_on_429

@rate_limited
def my_function():
    # Function automatically rate limited
    pass

@retry_on_429(max_retries=3, base_delay=2.0)
def my_api_call():
    # Function will retry on 429 errors with exponential backoff
    pass
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Check Rate Limiter Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/rate-limiter-status
```

### Reset Circuit Breaker (Admin Only)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/rate-limiter-reset \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

### Test Rate Limiting
```bash
python test_rate_limiting.py
```

## Expected Behavior

### Normal Operation
- API calls spaced 3+ seconds apart
- No 429 errors
- Circuit breaker remains closed

### After 429 Errors
- Delays increase exponentially (3s → 6s → 12s → 24s)
- After 5 consecutive 429s, circuit breaker opens
- All API calls blocked for 60 seconds
- Automatic recovery after timeout

### Recovery
- Delays decrease after successful calls
- Circuit breaker closes automatically
- Normal operation resumes

## Performance Impact

### Positive Effects
- ✅ Eliminates 429 errors
- ✅ Improves API reliability
- ✅ Prevents cascading failures
- ✅ Better user experience

### Trade-offs
- ⚠️ Slower response times (3+ seconds between calls)
- ⚠️ Reduced parallelism (5 workers instead of 20-30)
- ⚠️ Potential timeouts for batch operations

## Troubleshooting

### Circuit Breaker Stuck Open
1. Check rate limiter status: `/api/rate-limiter-status`
2. Wait for automatic timeout (60 seconds)
3. Or manually reset: `/api/rate-limiter-reset`

### Still Getting 429 Errors
1. Verify all modules use centralized rate limiter
2. Check for un-rate-limited API calls
3. Increase delays in configuration
4. Monitor external API rate limits

### Performance Issues
1. Reduce `calls_per_second` for more conservative limiting
2. Increase `circuit_breaker_timeout` for longer recovery
3. Adjust `max_workers` based on API capacity

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements
- **Distributed rate limiting** - For multiple server instances
- **API-specific limits** - Different limits for different services
- **Dynamic adjustment** - Automatic rate limit tuning
- **Metrics collection** - Track API call patterns and success rates
- **Cache warming** - Pre-populate cache during low-traffic periods

### Alternative Solutions
- **Multiple API keys** - Rotate between different Yahoo Finance accounts
- **Proxy rotation** - Use different IP addresses
- **Alternative data sources** - Fallback to other financial data providers
- **WebSocket connections** - Real-time data feeds instead of REST APIs

## Conclusion

This comprehensive rate limiting system should resolve the persistent 429 errors by:
1. **Coordinating all API calls** through a single rate limiter
2. **Implementing exponential backoff** to handle temporary rate limit issues
3. **Using circuit breakers** to prevent cascading failures
4. **Providing monitoring and control** endpoints for debugging

The system is designed to be self-healing and automatically recover from rate limit issues while maintaining API reliability.
